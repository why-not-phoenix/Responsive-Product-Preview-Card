## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learnt how to use the hover state of one element to affect another element.

```css
.purchase-button:hover ~ .product-paragraph {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

As always, still trying to find my feet in responsiveness but I am definitely improving. This was fun.

## Acknowledgments

Got the idea for using hover of one element to affect another from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4502633/how-to-affect-other-elements-when-one-element-is-hovered).
